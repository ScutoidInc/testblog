I am a front-end web designer and software developer, proficient in Python, JS, and C++. Apart from these, my area of interest lies in a closed interval of Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Complexity along with Game Theory, Combinatorics, and Cryptography. Besides these, I'm a passionate photographer, traveller, hardcore chess addict, and above all an ultimate procrastinator.
